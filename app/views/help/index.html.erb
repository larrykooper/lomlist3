<p class="faq_question">3. What are tags and how do I use them? </p>

<p>My philosophy is to delete it when it is done. If another part or aspect of the item needs to be done, I prefer to create a new item.</p>

<p class="faq_question">6. What are Act Types?</p>

<p>Act Types are a broader category than Tags. I've started you off with a few Act Types, but you can add, change, or delete them.    </p>
<p>Initial Act types:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>MA</td><td>My agenda</td><td>Things you do for their own sake. New experiences like travel. </td></tr>
<tr><td>SEC</td><td>Secondary items on my agenda</td><td>Not maintenance, but not things that make you wildly happy either. For me buying clothes falls into this category. </td></tr>
<tr><td>MAINT</td><td>Maintenance</td><td>Things that when done, will just get you back to where you were before. Examples are fixing things or buying routine items.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FO</td><td>For others</td><td>Things you want to do primarily for other people.</td></tr>
<tr><td>BUDG</td><td>Budget and finances</td><td>Items related to saving money, paying bills, budgeting, managing finances.</td></tr>
